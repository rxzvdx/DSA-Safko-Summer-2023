Pre Order T - Visit, Left, Right

Post Order T - Left, Right, Visit

In Order T - Left, Visit, Right
QOTD:  Given a tree of T, M, G, C, B, K, H, W, U, V, X give the preorder, postorder, and inorder of the tree.

Pre Order: T -> M -> G -> C -> B -> K -> H -> W -> U -> V -> X

Post Order: B -> C -> H -> K -> G -> M -> V -> U -> X -> W -> T

In Order: B -> C -> G -> H -> K -> M -> T -> U -> V -> W -> X


Recap:
Full: A binary tree with each node having 0 or 2 children
Complete: A levels filled, but level (n-1) is filled “completely” from the left
Perfect: A levels filled to max capacity.

$ - in order predecessor; largest item in the left subtree
$$ - in order successor; next element after root, i.e. root of right subtree

Map: key, value pair
M<k,v> 
{} Sets: An unordered list of related elements. Duplicates not permitted, but if they appear 
they're only counted once.
[] Bags: Also called a 'multiset'. An unordered list of related elements; duplicates permitted
<> Tuples: Also called a 'sequence' An ordered list of unrelated elements; duplicated permitted.
