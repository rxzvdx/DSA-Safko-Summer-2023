How can you (abuse?) a priority queue to sort a list?
What is big O of a priority queue?
Goes through list of n, n times so O(N^2).

To check a palindrome with a DEQ:
Put it onto the DEQ with nothing but alphas

Begin with topfront() to peek, then popFront() to remove
Compare topBack() and topFront(), if == remove them
If not, not a palindrome, cease iteration.

Check if size is one because when you get to the middle 
char it will crash as there is not a second element to remove.

Use compareTo() for ordering strings by ASCII value.

Trees:

A collection of vertices & edges where no cycle is produced.

Binary Tree:

Itâ€™s a tree where each vertex has 0, 1, or 2 leaf nodes.

Graphs: 

A graph is a collection of a set of vertices & edges.

Example: G = {V, E}
                V = {V1, v2, v3, v4, v5}
                E = {e1, e2, e3}
If an edge along v3 and v1 is a weight of 7. It will take 7 to reach between the nodes.
