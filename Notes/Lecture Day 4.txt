We will know if a circularly linked list is done when the tail points to 
the head. 
head.next = tmp;
tmp.next = head;

ArrayLists vs. LinkedList

Pros of ArrayList:
An array, and contiguous
Inherits from List class
Better for storing and accessing

Cons of ArrayList:
With every deletion, the array needs to be rebuilt
Slow
Default capacity of 10

Pros of LinkedList:
Uses doubly linked list
Fast
Can act as a list and a queue
Better for data manipulation

Cons of LinkedList:
Not contiguous

Stacks & Queues:
LIFO - last in first out - stack
FIFO - first in first out - queue
Check if palindrome with a stack by creating temp stack with previous 
stack elements and peeking, then popping each value, if all match 
then palindrome, if not then not a palindrome.
