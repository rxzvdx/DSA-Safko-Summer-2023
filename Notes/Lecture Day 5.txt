Pros and Cons for Arraylists and Linked Lists Java.util

Arraylists Pro: Sorting and accessing data
Arraylists Con: Dynamic array, meaning that every deletion causes the array to be rebuilt.
LinkedLists Pro: Good for manipulating data.
Linked List Con: Fractured nodes, making it non-contiguous.

Palindromes is kayak, racecar, madam
Madam, I’m Adam

{ { ( [ ] ) {  }<>} }

You push the left parameters and pop the right parameters. For example, (, [, {, or < will be pushed and any ), ], }, or > will be popped. However, if the species of the param doesn’t match, the check fails. This can be used for checking palindromes and balanced param.

Can we have a stack of queues? Yes
Can we have a queue of stacks? Yes

We already analyzed how to implement a palindrome checker using two stacks.

Can you do it using 1 stack and 1 queue?
Yes. Example used was Kayak
Can you do it using a single deque?
Yes. Kayak was used as an example again.
Can you do it using 2 queues?
Yes. Kayak used as an example again in all uppercase.
Can you use it using DEQ?
Yes.

Anagram Checker
Using anagram, (using sorting).

RPN Calculator

RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) Calculator can be an example for the stream of using stacks.

RPN of 6 * 2 + 4 = 6, 2, , 4, +
RPN of 6 (2 + 4) = 6, 2, 4, +, *
= 2 + 4 = 6 * 6 = 36.
