1. What is a Minimal Cost Spanning Tree (MCST)?
Tree that connects nodes from a graph with least amount of weight (weight of edges).

2. What is the process for generating on MCST using Prim's Algorithm?
(Prim starts with vertices), pick the node to begin with, then starting
from said node and continue adding nodes while not forming a cycle.

3. ..... Kruskal's algorithm?
(Kruskal starts with edges; lowest edge), build from there and do
not form a cycle.
